#Â coinpon!
coinpon is a game where individuals host their own 'arcades' (coinpon servers), where they can create gachapon machines for users to play with!

by default, users are granted a coin for every 5 minutes they're online, and every 30 they're not, which they can then use on the gachapon machines made by the arcade owner!

this was a simple game i made within the span of a week for week 5 of hackclub's siege, where the theme was to make something with coins

i'll update this readme in the future with better instructions on hosting an arcade and creating gachapon machines, but that'll come at a later date

the official instance will be at pon.enhancedrock.hackclub.app

not all features are implemented!! here's what is:
- the account, machine/sets, cards and gacha api
- the gacha client
