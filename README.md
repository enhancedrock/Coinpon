coinpon is a game where individuals host their own 'arcades' (coinpon servers), where they can create gachapon machines for users to play with!

by default, users are granted a coin for every 5 minutes they're online, and every 30 they're not, which they can then use on the gachapon machines made by the arcade owner!

this was a simple game i made within the span of a week for week 5 of hackclub's siege, where the theme was to make something with coins

i'll update this readme in the future with better instructions on hosting an arcade and creating gachapon machines, but that'll come at a later date

the official instance will be at pon.enhancedrock.hackclub.app


to use a coinpon machine, insert coins by clicking the coin slot until NEED reaches 00
you'll hear a click and the knob will rotate when it's unlocked, where you can then grab it and turn it (clockwise) to get a capsule!
the capsule will open, and you'll be presented with a card from the machine.


not all features are implemented!! here's what is:
- the account, machine/sets, cards and gacha api
- the gacha client
- storing cards
- the auth portal
- active coins(?)

here's what isn't yet:
- auction house
- trading
- recycling
- a card collection page
